# tranSMART-dataquality

This repository contains the project data needed to build a dataquality-Plugin in tranSMART using SmartR.  
To use these contents, you have to copy the `SmartR` folder into the `SmartR` folder of your tranSMART binaries.  
Afterwards one has to build the `.war`-file using Grails.
